# F-35 Birthday Registration - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Playful Military Aesthetic

**Reference Direction:** Blend serious military aviation UI (fighter jet HUD interfaces, tactical displays) with bright, approachable birthday party vibes. Think "Top Gun meets Chuck E. Cheese" - tactical precision with childish joy.

**Core Design Principle:** Contrast serious F-35 military elements with unexpectedly playful execution. Use authentic aviation UI patterns but render them in cheerful colors with corny microcopy.
